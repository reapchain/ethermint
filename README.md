Reapchain Ethermint is a scalable and interoperable Ethereum library, built on Proof-of-Stake with fast-finality using the [Reapchain Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/reapchain/cosmos-sdk/) which runs on top of [Reapchain Core](https://github.com/reapchain/reapchain-core) consensus engine.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.18+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Introduction

The Reapchain Ethermint is a fork of the Evmos Ethermint [v0.19.0](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/tree/v0.19.0). We, the Reapchain Team, have integrated our Consensus Engine which we call the Reapchain Core on top of the Open Source code available in the Evmos Ecosystem. By utilizing the Reapchain Ethermint as well as the Reapchain Core Consensus Engine, you will be able to create your own Proof-of-Stake blockchains.

## Installation

```bash
make install
```
